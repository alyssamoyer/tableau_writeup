## Seasonality

Overall there was a decrease in bike trips in the winter compared to the fall. The number of bike trips decreased 60% from September 2019 to December 2019. To fully understand this I would want to take a couple of years of data and do a YoY comparison to see if we see the same trend in previous years.

## User Type

There was no significant variation in the amount of trips taken by customers and subscribers. Both groups saw the same type of seasonal decrease in trips during the winter. There was a significant difference in the daily median trip duration of the two groups. Customer trip duration varied across time from 6 minutes to 20 minutes and tended to be longer than subscriber trips. There was very little variation in subscriber median trip duration and their trips tended to be short with the longest median trip duration being 7 minutes.
