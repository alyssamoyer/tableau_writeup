## Seasonality

Overall there was a decrease in bike trips in the winter compared to the fall. The number of bike trips decreased 60% from September 2019 to December 2019. To fully understand this I would want to take a couple of years of data and do a YoY comparison to see if we see the same trend in previous years.
